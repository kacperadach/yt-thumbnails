## Usability Issues

Fixes:

- DND resize when rotated
- DND rotate 

- defaults need to look a lot better + add text presets

- fix arrow alignment on render
- fix arrow hidden selection box
- fix shapes, use Remotion package

- fix video, see if it can be done w/o download

- only allow gradient if valid

Maybe:

- clicking off thumbnail should deselect all elements

New features:

- DND alignment lines
- add filter effects
- need brand kits
- DND z-index in assets menu
- transform perspective

Done:

- DND resize
- DND drag use anchor point (dont snap to middle)
- rotation buttons
- before creating new image, allow user to select image/upload
- font should auto use what over texts use, also show all used fonts at top
- borders/shadows very confusing to use in edit menu
- order settings more logically, stuff like padding shouldnt be at the top
- color picker should be in separate menu
- edit menu needs to scroll, cant be scrolling page

Recommendation for thumbnail bro: hard contrast (white borders around Rush) don't generate as many clicks anymore, the best practice is to over-sharpen the face and apply a slight blur and darken/lighten the contour around the person, instead of a hard solid contour.
